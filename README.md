# Chlorine 3.0.EXE

A cool virus me and my friend made!
He lost access to his github account so we decided to put it here
This repository contains both the clean version and the destructive version. 

# Features
(destructive)
MBR.exe runs as soon as the virus is cleared to run (Chlorine will show a message box before preceeding)
Discord webhook Iplogger! It will run this the same time mbr runs, see main.py for the logger
Microsoft Defender evasion. This version is undetectable! (almost ready)
