# Python

These are the IP Loggers, Replace the url with your discord webhook url, then compile it to exe onefile.

In order to run these, you need to use pip to get the module requests

```
pip install requests
```

main.py is for the destructive version of chlorine
mainclean.py is for the clean version of chlorine 

Each version of the logger has its own message it sends. so you can tell what form of the virus the target executed
The target machine has to have an internet connection to send the messge requests

icanhazip.com is just a site that spits out the targets ip in text with out all the ui and css stuff a website would have

See comments in main.py for more info on the code
